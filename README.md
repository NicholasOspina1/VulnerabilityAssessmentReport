# Vulnerability Assessment Report


-------

# Description <a name="description">

A fictional company is in need of a Vulnerability Assessment Report. You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability. 

I created a written report that clearly explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured. This assessment was completed as a component of my cybersecurity portfolio and as part of the <a href='https://www.coursera.org/google-certificates/cybersecurity-certificate'>Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate</a> on Coursera, specifically in the  <a href='https://www.coursera.org/learn/assets-threats-and-vulnerabilities'> "Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities" </a> Course.


# System Description <a name="scenario">
128GB of memory and a potent CPU processor make up the server hardware. It has a MySQL database management system and is powered by the most recent version of the Linux operating system. It communicates with other servers on the network and is set up with a reliable IPv4 network connection. SSL/TLS encrypted connections are among the security precautions.

Scope  <a name="control-assessment">
===================
This vulnerability assessment's scope is related to the system's present access controls.
The evaluation will take place between June 20XX and August 20XX, a span of three months. The information system's risk analysis follows NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1.

Purpose  <a name="control-assessment">
===================

Large volumes of data are managed and stored by a centralized computer system called the database server. In order to track results and tailor marketing campaigns, the server is used to store customer, campaign, and analytical data. Because the system is regularly used for marketing operations, security is essential.

Approach  <a name="control-assessment">
===================
The business's data storage and management practices were taken into account when measuring risks. Based on the possibility of a security incident considering the information system's open access permissions, potential threat sources and events were identified. The impact on regular operational requirements was considered in relation to the seriousness of potential incidents.

Remediation Strategy  <a name="control-assessment">
===================
To guarantee that only authorized users have access to the database server, mechanisms for auditing, authentication, and authorization must be implemented. Limiting user privileges can be achieved through the use of multi-factor authentication, role-based access controls, and strong passwords. TLS encryption of data in transit as opposed to SSL encryption. To stop arbitrary internet users from connecting to the database, corporate offices can use IP allow-listing.
